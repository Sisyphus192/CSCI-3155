    "\n",
    "You have 2 options to run this project: IntelliJ or sbt.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (The community edition is fine, though students can get Ultimate for free) with the Scala plugin installed. This makes compiling and running the project a cinch.\n",

    "To build, run, and test this project you will need JDK8 and either IntelliJ + scala plugin or sbt.\n",

    "### JDK 8\n",
    "*If you are on the CU virtual machine, you already have this installed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run these projects without a VM, select the relevent installer from [this page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).\n",

    "### IntelliJ IDEA\n",

    "Instructions for CU VM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the .tar.gz file\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and `cd ~/Downloads`\n",
    "3. Run `sudo tar xf ideaIC-2018.3.4.tar.gz -C /opt/`\n",
    "4. Run `cd /opt/idea-IC-183.5429.30/`\n",
    "5. Run `./bin/idea.sh` \n",
    "6. Go through the installer (when you get to feeatured plugins make sure to install scala)\n",
    "7. Open the project (not the whole repo! just the project).\n",
    "8. Navigate to a .scala file (like src/main/scala/edu/colorado/csci3155/project1/Expr.scala).\n",
    "9. It should ask you to setup the scala SDK, click the link on the upper right:\n",
    "![title](img/sdk_1.png)\n",
