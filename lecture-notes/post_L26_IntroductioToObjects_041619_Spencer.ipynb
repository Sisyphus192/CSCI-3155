    "## Why Study Objects?\n",
    "* Most if not all, modern (non-esoteric) programming languages today support objects and use them behind the scenes to ensure type safety in the programming language\n",
    "* Many software companies expect that new hires are able to apply object concepts to their programming\n",
    "* This course is a prerequisite for OOAD and it wouldn’t be fair for us to not study this concept a bit\n",
    "    * ASIDE: I don't know what OOAD looks like now that there is a new instructor, but... it used to be a project course. If you want to take this course, I'd recommend taking it with some friends and entering the course with a few project ideas ready to go.\n",
    "* Personally, a few months back I applied to work for MinuteKey here in Boulder as a Scala developer. They make those key creation kiosks that you see at walmart and such. They are using AI to remotely fix issues with their hardware. Anyway, the short of the story is that they liked my coding skills in Scala but they didn't love it. They wanted me to be using more OO concepts, which I wasn't using because I never learned it and didn't want to teach myself. Ultimately, they recommended that I look at the Coarsera course on Scala before re-applying to the position. Apperantly that Coarsera course is a great resource for learning Scala for production level code. \n",
    "    * Given the core knowledge you've learned in this course, that shouldn't be difficult for you. Check it out if you're interested: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala\n",
